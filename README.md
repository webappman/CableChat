# CableChat
Create a Chat App with Rails 5, ActionCable, and Devise.

 Rails 5 has introduced a bunch of new great features, but one of the most anticipated ones is of course ActionCable. ActionCable seamlessly integrates WebSockets into your application and offers both client-side JS and server-side Ruby frameworks. This way, you can write real-time features in the same styles as the rest your application, which is really cool.

## Install
* install Ruby -v 2.4.1 and Rails -v 5.0.1
* bundle install
* rake db:create db:migrate db:schema:load db:seed
